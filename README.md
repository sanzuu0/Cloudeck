# Cloudeck

A file storage system where control stays with the user. You decide who can interact with your files and how — from private access to collaborative work.

> **Status:** Pre-alpha / bootstrap. There is no executable code in this repository yet; structure and interfaces may change.

---

## What is this

The goal is to build a convenient and secure storage layer that scales, is transparently observable, and integrates easily into products. At this stage, the repository contains the scaffolding and process: protected `main`, documentation, and baseline rules.
